I enjoy so much in drawing down the scenes I see or in my mind with my pen and taking photos of all the beautiful things in the nature in lights and shadows. Part of my art works are listed bellow, including some paintings, photographies, maya models, graphic designs, etc. For more pics, you can visit my lofter page <http://sparkmorry.lofter.com/>
