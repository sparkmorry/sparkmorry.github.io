    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Yes, still cannot help missing him.</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s been almost 7 years, since we first met. You sat there still at the back of the room, looking at me. Silence, and heart beating so loudly. I thought I must have met you before, but actually not. Being a classmate of you, I didn&rsquo;t talk to you except the first days when you kept asking my name. Feeling so sorrow to be forgotten, we were just too young to love.</p>

<p>The real story began about 5 years ago. It was a hard time with the endless homework for a third-year high school student in China. The only common thing among us could be that we are both boarders, and good at physics in a way. You started to talk with me, asked me questions, glared at me when I was talking to other boy, playing with my pens, looked at me when I was called by the teacher for questions like a real couple, but actually we were not. Those sweet days were kept in my whole life, I thought I was flipped, completely. I swear I loved you more than any boyfriend I have ever dated.</p>

<p>Not all stories get a happy ending. It ends up with my stupid stubbornness and pride. I know it&rsquo;s hard to restart, but I will try. Before that, I still want to improve myself so that to talk to you without my inferiority the next time I see you. As you deserve a better girl. Life is long, it&rsquo;s never too late to chatch. Focus on my next 3 years, and hope it sparks!</p>

<p>Congratulations!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>yours,</br>
forever admirer.</p>
